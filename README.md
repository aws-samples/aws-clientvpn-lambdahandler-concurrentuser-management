# Optimizing AWS Client VPN Concurrent User Management: Lambda Handler for Seamless Login Control
The Lambda handler code presented in the repository addresses the security and access control challenges associated with simultaneous logins using identical credentials in AWS Client VPN. This solution offers a streamlined approach to managing concurrent user logins effectively. By incorporating custom logic into the Lambda handler, users gain insights into authorizing only the latest connection upon user authentication. This enables automatic termination of older connections, thereby enhancing security measures while ensuring a seamless user experience within the AWS Client VPN environment. Through the implementation of this handler, users can bolster their security protocols and maintain efficient access control practices within their AWS infrastructure.
## Use Case
A potential use case in real world could be let's say an organization relies on AWS Client VPN for secure remote access to its resources. In this environment, users occasionally log in from different devices simultaneously using the same credentials, creating a potential security vulnerability. With the default behavior allowing all these connections to establish, there is a risk of unauthorized access and compromised access controls. To address this challenge, the introduced Lambda handler provides a practical solution by implementing custom logic. This use case demonstrates how organizations can enhance security and streamline user access in their AWS Client VPN environment, ensuring that only the latest connection is authorized while automatically terminating older connections associated with identical user credentials.
## Deployment

To deploy this solution you just have to copy the python code from the lambdaHandler.py file and use it in our lambda Handler for aws Client VPN.
